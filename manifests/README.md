# 4GonK8S
Emulation of 4G images on a Kubernetes cluster deployed locally as k3s nodes using k3d project

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to emulate a full 4G environment in order to provide a useful testbed for different scenarios and evaluations. The following steps show how to start by a single laptop and become able to run a full testbed on a locally deployed Kubernetes cluster.

The following solutions and projects used have been selected as best fitted for the work. 

## 0. Ubuntu installation and configuration

For present work the OS used has been Ubuntu 18.04 LTS https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/

## 1. Kubernetes local cluster

Once Ubuntu has been installed correctly it is necessary to install Docker and deploy Kubernetes local cluster.

### Docker installation
### k3s/k3d
### Calico networking
### kubectl installation

## 2. 4G emulation

## 3. Testing
